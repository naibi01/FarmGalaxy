# FarmGalaxy

[Live Demo](https://naibi01.github.io/FarmGalaxy/)

FarmGalaxy is an interactive dashboard + simulation platform that fuses real-world field data with NASA’s satellite datasets to help farmers and learners make data-driven decisions. It also features a gamified farming experience.

## 🛰️ Features & Highlights

- **Real-Time Field Monitoring**  
  Displays metrics like soil moisture, temperature, vegetation health, and pH for a specific field location.  
  *Ex:* “Irrigation Needed: 450 L/ha in the next 4 hours” alert.  
  Located field vs. regional baseline comparisons (NASA data).  

- **7-Day Forecast & Sustainability Metrics**  
  Shows rainfall forecast and computes potential water savings vs. traditional farming.  

- **Game / Simulation Mode**  
  (Labelled “Farmer Game”) – users can simulate farming decisions (planting, irrigating, fertilizing) under varying conditions.  

- **Regional Comparisons**  
  Displays how your field’s metrics compare to NASA’s regional or baseline data.

## 📱 How It Works (Architecture Overview)

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Local sensor input / API data feed (soil moisture, pH, temperature, etc.)  
   - Satellite data from NASA (MODIS, SMAP, GPM, etc.)

2. **Data Fusion & Analytics**  
   - Local + satellite datasets combined  
   - Simple algorithms / models to provide recommendations and alerts

3. **User Interface**  
   - Dashboard showing current field conditions, alerts, forecasts  
   - Simulator / Game mode for decision-making practice  
   - Mobile-friendly layout
